curvefitting using dynamic programming", "abstract": "in a recent paper bellman showed how dynamic programming could be used to determine the solution  to a problem previously considered by stone  the problem comprises the determination given n of the  n points of subdivision of a given interval ab and the corresponding line segments that give the  best least squares fit to a function gx in the interval  bellman confined himself primarily to the  analytical derivation suggesting briefly however how the solution of the equation derived for each  particular point of subdivision ui could be reduced to a discrete search  in this paper the computational  procedure is considered more fully and the similarities to some of stones equations are indicated  it is further shown that an equation for ui involving no minimization may be found  in addition  it is shown how bellmans method may be applied to the curvefitting problem when the additional constraints  are added that the ends of the line segments must be on the curve"}, "498": {"title": "magic square algorithm   "}, "499": {"title": "permutation generator algorithm "}, "500": {"title": "permute algorithm "}, "501": {"title":

benefit from optimization whereas  other parameters controllable by the scheduling algorithm affect system performance in a predictable  manner and would not benefit from optimization  features not

olog n where n is the number of nodes in the tree  this represents an improvement over the best previous ly known insertion algorithms of hirschberg and kosaraju which require time olog n  moreover the olog n complexity is optimal earlier  results have shown that deletion in such a structure can also be performed in olog n time  thus the result of this paper gives a negative answer to the question of whether such trees should be the first examples of their kind where deletion has a smaller time  complexity than insertion  furthermore it can now be concluded that insertion deletion and retrieval in oshb trees can be performed in the same time as the corresponding operations for the more general avl trees to within a constant factor  however the insertion and deletion algorithms for oshb trees appear much more complicated than the corresponding algorithms for avl trees"}, "3164": {"title": "progressive acyclic digraphsa tool for database integrity", "abstract": "a progressive
